This is where I will be putting the source for the ten.java plugin contest.
I am coding for the 1600 UTC contest.
Topic: Entities
Please run on the latest 1.6.4 Recommended Build.

This plugin adds extra "drops" to some of the mobs. Not all of these "drops" are items drops.

These are the extra drops that mobs can drop.

Blaze: 10 fireballs fired in random directions.
Cave Spider/Spider: Splash potion of poison launched in the direction it was facing.
Chicken: Snowball launched in the direction it was facing. (It was suppose to be an egg D:)
Creeper: TNT that causes fire explosion.
Enderman: Falling block of the block it was carrying (if it was carrying one) and an ender crystal.
Ghast: 10 big fireballs fired in random directions.
Giant: 30 rotten flesh (item).
Iron Golem: Falling pumpkin above a falling iron block.
Magma Cream: Falling lava with data 127, falling fire if size is 1.
Mooshroom: Falling red mushroom.
Zombie Pigman: Spawns a pig and a zombie. The zombie has the exact equipment as the zombie pigman. If the zombie pigmans is a baby then the pig and the zombie are also babies. If the zombie pigman is a villager, so is the zombie. They both has a max health of 1.
Sheep: Falling wool of its color.
